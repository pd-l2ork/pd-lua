Building this package for Debian
--------------------------------

This source package need no special handling for normal package builds.


Developing this package for Debian
----------------------------------

This package uses CDBS as the build system and git for maintainance.
NMUs need not (but are encouraged to) make special use of these tools.
In particular, the debian/control.in file can be completely ignored.

For a quick start, see
	http://wiki.debian.org/CDBS+git-buildpackage


editing debian/control
----------------------
Please note, that we would welcome it if you do NOT modify debian/control
directly, as this file will be generated from debian/control.in using CDBS.
Therefore you ought to change debian/control.in and trigger a re-creation of
debian/control using:
$ DEB_MAINTAINER_MODE=1 dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

git-tuneclone.sh
----------------

This package comes with a script 'debian/git-tuneclone.sh'.
Running it after a fresh clone of the packaging repository
will fine-tune your local copy, namely:
- make git ignore any .pc/ directory (created by quilt)
- enable the "-follow-tags" when running 'git-push', so it's harder
  to forget to push packaging tags along with the branches.
- do an initial checkout of the 3 packaging branches (master, pristine-tar,
  upstream)
The script only needs to run once (though running it multiple times shouldn't
matter).
You are of course free to *not* run the script, if you prefer.
