Description: lua bindings for Pure Data
 pd-lua adds a new loader to Pure Data (Pd), that allows one to load
 objectclasses written in the popular lua programming language.
 .
 Some programming problems are complicated to express in graphical
 dataflow languages like Pd, requiring the user to ressort to objectclasses
 written in more general purpose languages.
 For those who do not want to use compiled languages like C/C++, this package
 offers the possibility to write first-class objectclasses in the lightweight
 programming language "lua".
