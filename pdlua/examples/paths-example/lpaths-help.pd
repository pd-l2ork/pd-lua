#X text 14 97 There is a copy of lpaths.pd_lua in the directory of this help patch \, and in the 'subdir' folder. There are 2 different hello.txt files with different contents in both directories \, that are loaded and printed with 'load' and 'loadx' messages \, corresponding to _canvaspath and _loadpath respectively.;
#X text 14 14 This example demonstrates the use of self._canvaspath and self._loadpath. _canvaspath will give the directory of the canvas that the object is created in \, whereas _loadpath will give the directory that the .pd_lua file is loaded from. Both have trailing slashes added for convenience.;
